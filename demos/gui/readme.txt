There are many ways of creating GUI for Jason agents.
All of them relies on Java.

This directory contains the following examples:

gui1: uses and internal action to ask something to the user

gui2: creates a window with buttons that, when pressed,
      produce events the agent can react to.


Some examples of Jason also use GUI:

auction: uses a customised agent architecture that provides special
         actions to show information in a GUI

domestic-robot, iterated-prisoners-dilemma, and many others: the GUI
        is implemented and maintained by the environment.
