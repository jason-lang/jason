//NOTE: This tutorial is not update for Jason 3.2, where Gradle is used to run Jade and not `.mas2j`. But the general idea remains. If you would like to see this tutorial updated, add an issue at GitHub.


This document aims to show how to create Jason agents that
participate in a multi-agent system (MAS) composed by "`normal`" JADE
agents (by normal we mean being not developed considering
interoperability with Jason). We will
develop a Jason book-seller agent that joins the system of the
traditional example of book trading that comes with JADE. The JADE
code will remain as in the example, it will not be changed to
interoperate with Jason.

// == Accessing the JADE DF

// The first thing a seller agent should do is to register itself as a
// book seller in the JADE DF (Directory Facilitator) service.

// The following steps create a new Jason project for our seller agent:

// - Create a new project called "`book_trading`" that uses Jade as
//   the infrastructure.
// +
// image:./figures/screen-create-project.png[]

// - Create the first version of the seller agent, called
//   `john`, with the following code:
// +
// [source,jasonagent]
// .john.asl
// ----
// /* Initial beliefs and rules */

// // A 'book' belief has three arguments:
// //   . the title
// //   . its price
// //   . the quantity in stock

// book("Harry", 32, 20).
// book("Jason", 50, 10).


// /* Initial goals */

// !registerDF.

// /* Plans */

// +!registerDF <- .df_register("JADE-book-trading", "book-selling"). // name, type
// ----
// +
// - You can now run the project and use the menu option Tools ->
//   Show DF of the RMA agent to inspect the DF:

== A seller agent in Jason

The buyer agent, written in JADE, retrieves information about all
sellers from the DF, and then sends a CFP (call for proposal) message
to all those agents. The Jason agent has two tasks:

- register itself in the DF as book seller, and
- handle messages sent from buyers.

The first task is performed with the Jason internal action `.df_register` (see the agent code below).


For the second task, since Jason agents use KQML-like performatives,
the performatives used by JADE agents are not available in Jason,
i.e., the semantics of those performatives are not implemented in
Jason (which implements the semantics of performatives such as tell,
askOne, achieve, etc.). We need therefore to write "`low level`" plans
to handle in AgentSpeak the CFP messages from JADE agents.

Every message that arrives in to Jason agent (and is accepted for
processing) produces an event like `+!kqml_received(Sender, Performative, Content, MsgId)` (the MsgId should be used to reply to
the message). We can then create plans to handle this event in the
particular case where the performative is CFP or ACCEPT_PROPOSAL:

[source,jasonagent]
.john.asl

== Running the system

You can download all the application from link:./book_trading.zip[here]. 

The JADE 'normal' agent can be started with `./gradlew runJadeAgs`. This Gradle task essentially runs `java jade.Boot -gui bob:examples.bookTrading.BookBuyerAgent(Harry)`, where the agent implementation is provided by JADE. The output will be:

// Follow the steps below to run the system with JADE and Jason agents:

// - Start the JADE main container and the seller agent using the
//   image:./figures/run.png[] button in jEdit.

// - Download the buyer agent from
//   link:./jade-example.zip[here]. (It is distributed as an example of
//   JADE)

// - Compile the JADE examples
// ----
// export CLASSPATH=~/jason/libs/jade-XXXX.jar:.  <1>
// cd jade-example
// javac examples/bookTrading/Book*.java
// ----
// <1> Where XXXX is the release of Jade in the `libs` folder and `~/jason` is where Jason was installed.

// - Start the buyer, called `bob`, in a new container using
//   the command
// ----
// java jade.Boot -container -host localhost "bob:examples.bookTrading.BookBuyerAgent(Harry)"

...
Hallo! Buyer-agent bob@10.200.0.100:1099/JADE is ready.
Target book is Harry
Trying to buy Harry
Found the following seller agents:
Trying to buy Harry
Found the following seller agents:
----

Now you can run the Jason agent with `./gradlew runJohn`. This Gradle task essentially runs `java jade.Boot -container john:jason.infra.jade.JadeAgArch(src/agt/john.asl)`. The output will be:

----
....
Agent container Container-1@10.200.0.100 is ready.
starting john
Agent mind inspector is running at http://127.0.0.1:3272
New stock for Harry is 19
----

image:./figures/ams2.png[]

and in the output where Bob is running will change as follows, indicating it found agent john:
----
Trying to buy Harry
Found the following seller agents:
john@10.200.0.100:1099/JADE
Harry successfully purchased from agent john@10.200.0.100:1099/JADE
Price = 32
Buyer-agent bob@10.200.0.100:1099/JADE terminating.
----




// You can also run the whole system without jEdit:

// - First start the buyer in the main container:
// ----
// java jade.Boot -gui "bob:examples.bookTrading.BookBuyerAgent(Harry)"

// ----
// - Start the Jason seller as follows (ensure that all JADE jars
//   are in the CLASSPATH):
// ----
// cd <directory where the book_trading example was saved>
// export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:bin/classes
// java jade.Boot -container -host localhost "john:jason.infra.jade.JadeAgArch(john.asl)"
// ----



== Exercises


- Run the agents in different machines.
- Write the code for a buyer agent in Jason that uses the DF to
  find sellers, sends a CFP, select the cheapest, and only then buys
  the book.
