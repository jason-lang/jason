== with Gradle

Requirements:

- Java >= 8
- Gradle

You have to install https://gradle.org[Gradle] on your computer and then run the following commands to create a new application (the first time you run them, it takes a while to finish since it downloads Jason first):
-----
curl -s -O http://jason.sourceforge.net/np/np24.gradle
gradle -b np24.gradle --console=plain
-----

NOTE: `np24.gradle` creates an application based on Jason 2.4. You can replace it by `npss.gradle` to create a JaCaMo application based on the current snap shot version. https://curl.haxx.se[`curl`] is a program that simply downloads the `np24.gradle` file from http://jason.sourceforge.net/np/np24.gradle.

You will be asked to enter the identification of the application and then instructions about how to run it will be shown.

Example of output:
----
> Task :run
Jason 2.4 built on Mon Oct 01 20:50:56 BRT 2018

Enter the identification of the new application: bobob
Creating path /Users/jomi/tmp/bobob

You can run your application with:
   $ cd /Users/jomi/tmp/bobob
   $ gradle -q --console=plain

an eclipse project can be created from menu File/Import,
option 'Existing Gradle Project'.
----

If you want to run a Jason application that was not created with a `build.gradle` file, you can download a template from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jason-lang/jason/master/src/main/resources/templates/build.gradle[here] and replace

- `<VERSION>` by the required Jason release (e.g. `2.4`)
- `<PROJECT-FILE>` by your .mas2j file (e.g. `hello.mas2j`).
- `<PROJECT-RUNNER-CLASS>` by `jason.infra.centralised.RunCentralisedMAS`

== with Scripts

Requirements:

- Java >= 8

The first step is to download Jason https://sourceforge.net/projects/jason/files/jason/[here] and unzip it. Then configure some environment variables: `JASON_HOME` should be the directory where you unzip the downloaded file (it should have the directories `libs` and `scripts` inside) and `PATH`. For example;

    export JASON_HOME=$HOME/pro/jason-2.4
    export PATH=$JASON_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. New applications can be created with

     jason-new-project nameofapplication

. The Jason IDE based on jEdit can be run with
+
----
jason-ide
----

. Jason projects (`.mas2j` files) can be run with

    jason ../somewhere/some-project.mas2j


== Atom

For an IDE lighter than Eclipse, we recommend https://atom.io[Atom]. The following package provide syntax highlight for AgentSpeak (the Jason language): https://atom.io/packages/language-agentspeak[language-agentspeak].
